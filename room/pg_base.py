pg_base.py — palette, constants, textures, primitives, and the shared
extended view state.

The lowest layer of pg_live's twelve-module split: everything that
other modules read but do not own.  Nothing here depends on any other
live module; everything else depends on this one.

Contents
--------
    • PALETTE               — the dark-theme colour system
    • SHEET CONSTANTS       — dimension-tick, balloon, zoom, split
                              constants shared by every renderer
    • CABLE_STROKE          — cable width recipes (halo / ink pairs)
    • EXTENDED VIEW STATE   — the fields this half of the split adds to
                              pg_core's viewFloor / viewWall / state /
                              mouse, plus session-scoped NOTES and the
                              panel-fade flags
    • SCREEN TEXTURES       — the three hatch patterns the sheet uses
    • SHARED DRAWING HELPERS — the atoms: rounded rect, value pill,
                              coloured variant, snap crosshair
    • GRID LABEL / PILL     — the ruled pill that terminates a grid
                              line in either view

The extended view state lives here because it is the one place every
module reads from and no module exclusively owns.  It extends the state
pg_core.py declares; the rules that constrain it (zoom clamp, pan
arithmetic) live in pg_navigation.py, and the palette that colours it
lives above.

viewWall carries two independent scale factors:

    zoom     uniform — applied to both axes.  Adjusted by the plain
             wheel over the wall band, and by Shift+wheel over the
             floor band (which is isotropic and has no X-only mode).
    zoomX    horizontal-only — applied to viewWall.scaleX alone.
             Adjusted by Shift+wheel over the wall band.  Dilation
             leaves every vertical dimension untouched, which is what
             you want when a narrow wall's cable geometry is packed
             too tightly to read but the height scale is fine.

zoomX = 1 is a no-op; the two compose, so a uniform zoom of 1.5 with
an X-stretch of 2.0 gives scaleX a factor of 3.0 and scaleY a factor
of 1.5.  The wall-band reset (Home, or the panel's zoom-reset button)
zeroes both.

   PALETTE
   ==========================================================================
   Light ink on a deep, cool paper.  The polarity of the light theme
   is inverted without touching the sheet idiom: what used to be black
   ink is now cool grey, what used to be white paper is now near-black,
   and the three semantic accents are pushed into an electric register
   so they carry the visual weight that, on white paper, the ink alone
   used to carry.

     • ink        — structural stroke for every cable, wall, dimension,
                    grid, ruler, anchor, and sheet frame
     • paper      — the canvas, and the knockout halo under every
                    stroke, and the fill of a wall chunk in the strip
     • paperTint  — the wall band.  In the light theme this sat one
                    step BELOW paper (#f4f4f4 under #ffffff) so a wall
                    chunk read as raised.  Here it sits one step DEEPER
                    than paper (#060a10 under #0a0e14) for the same
                    reason, in the same direction.
     • step       — magenta.  Step risers (z_hi dashes, dimension chain
                    accents, step-bridge bars)
     • transit    — cyan.  Anything crossing between the two views:
                    hop arcs, cross-view boundary dots, escape arrows,
                    the SAVE outline, the armed ruler button, the
                    ruler's numeric input, the measure inspector, and
                    a selected ruler measurement's value pill
     • highlight  — yellow.  Cursor, snap crosshair, merge-target ring,
                    live drawing preview, the live draw-button outline,
                    and a hovered / pending ruler measurement

   Every rgba variant keeps the same semantic slot as its solid; alpha
   values are chosen for a dark field where a 60 % ink reads like a
   40 % ink did on white. */

   of its predecessor rather than being covered by it.

   These widths set the cable's visual weight everywhere it renders —
   in the floor view, the wall view, and the hover highlight.  Halo to
   ink is held at roughly 2.2:1, the same proportion pg_export.py uses,
   so a screen cable and a printed cable of the same logical weight

   The fields this half of the split adds to pg_core's viewFloor /
   viewWall / state / mouse.  Extending rather than redeclaring keeps
   pg_core untouched — the const bindings stay the ones pg_core made,
   and every later module just reaches into the same objects.

   viewWall.zoomX is the horizontal-only stretch factor: it feeds
   viewWall.scaleX and nothing else, so the unfolded strip can be
   dilated sideways without touching any vertical dimension.  It is
   applied alongside viewWall.zoom inside fitViews, so the two
   compose multiplicatively and both feed the router base Xs that the
   arrow field and the ruler read.

   Session-scoped NOTES and the panel-fade flags are declared here too:
   they belong to no single view, and every renderer that reads them
   already reads from this module's palette. */

   SCREEN TEXTURES
   ==========================================================================
   Pattern weights are retuned for a dark field.  On white paper a
   0.55 px stroke at 100 % ink read as a crisp mark; on a dark field
   the same mark blooms, so the hatch weights are lifted slightly
   and the alphas dropped so the three fields keep their
   light / mid / faint hierarchy.

     crossHatch    — the hover highlight on every wall.  Two
                     diagonals at 0.6 px / 0.72 alpha.  Reads as
                     the drafting symbol for "attention here", and
                     stays distinct from the two single-direction
                     diagonals already in play.  Its alpha and
                     weight are the two knobs that control how loud
                     the highlight is: below roughly 0.35 / 0.45 the
                     mark fades into the wall's paper fill on a
                     dark field and the hover stops registering; at
                     full ink it reads as a solid block rather than
                     a hatch.  0.72 / 0.6 is deliberately in
                     between — bright enough to be unmistakable
                     against the surrounding strip, still sparse
                     enough that the wall's own dimension rules and
                     z_hi dashes show through it.
     voidHatch     — the wall band behind the chunks.  Faint enough
                     that the chunks sitting on it carry all the
                     contrast.
     planInterior  — the floor plan interior fill.  The lightest of
                     the three: a texture, not a highlight. */
