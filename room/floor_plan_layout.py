floor_plan_layout.py — label placement, dimension-line geometry,
notes-block placement, and leader routing for the floor-plan drawer.

Owns both the label positions and the leader geometries, because the
two are mutually constrained: a label should not sit on a leader, and
a leader should not pass through a label.  Owns the ruler geometry
too, for the same reason.

Ruler geometry — trapezoids and parallelograms
----------------------------------------------
Every ruler is drawn in one of two shapes:

    trapezoid      the classic symmetric lean.  Both extension lines
                   tilt inward along the wall's tangent; the dim line
                   is shorter than the wall by 2 × tilt.

    parallelogram  asymmetric.  The dim line keeps the wall's full
                   length and slides along the wall's tangent by
                   RULER_PARALLELOGRAM_SHIFT_UNITS; both extension
                   lines lean the same direction.

A ruler whose nominal-tilt dim line (wall_length − 2·tilt) falls
below RULER_PARALLELOGRAM_TRIGGER_UNITS gets parallelogram candidates
and a tiebreak bias toward choosing one.

Both sides for every ruler
--------------------------
Every ruler is scored on BOTH sides of its wall: the natural side
(chosen by inward_normal_via_holes — the side that faces into a
room) and its geometric opposite.  Each (side, gap, shape) triple is
scored with the same conflict count and the lowest-conflict one wins;
a small tiebreak penalty (RULER_SIDE_FLIP_PENALTY) keeps the natural
side when the two are close, so flipping only happens when it is
worth it.

Column dimension side selection
-------------------------------
Each column's width dim can be placed below or above the column, and
its height dim to the right or the left.  Both sides of each dim are
scored by pure crowding; the less crowded side wins.

The score combines two terms:

    segment grazing — how close the dim line, its extension lines,
                      and its ticks come to a foreign obstacle, up
                      to COL_DIM_CROWDING_UNITS.  An obstacle that
                      is COLLINEAR with the segment being checked
                      is a wall the segment is drawn along, not a
                      crossing; it does not count.

    label intrusion — whether the dim's value label would land on
                      top of a foreign obstacle.  This term is a
                      binary COL_DIM_LABEL_PENALTY per intersecting
                      obstacle.  An obstacle in the column's
                      `attached_walls` set (a wall the column is
                      flush against on some edge) is excluded, so a
                      narrow column's value can sit on top of the
                      wall it is attached to.  "Over the wall if you
                      must."

Attached-wall handling
----------------------
A column flush against a wall has one or more of its own edges
collinear with that wall.  Those walls are called *attached walls*.
Two consequences:

  1.  The column's own edge on the attached side is not drawn —
      the wall's boundary is already there, and drawing the column
      edge on top of it produces a doubled line.  The column outline
      is emitted as the column edge MINUS the attached-wall
      intervals, using the same axis-line + interval subtraction the
      step-edge classifier uses.  A column fully embedded on one
      side loses that entire edge; a column that only partially
      abuts a wall keeps the piece that juts out past the wall.

  2.  Attached walls (and the column's own edges, full and leftover)
      are added to the column dim label's `ignored_obstacles` set.
      Both the pre-relaxation scorer and the relaxation itself skip
      them for that label, so a narrow column's value can sit on top
      of the wall it is attached to without being pushed off.

Step edges — solid vs. dashed vs. merged
----------------------------------------
Every step polygon edge is one of three things in the plan:

    coincident with a wall face   the step is bounded by a wall on
                                  that side.  Drawn SOLID.

    free-standing riser           the step drops to open floor on
                                  that side.  Drawn DASHED.

    interior to a merged surface  the edge is shared with a
                                  neighbouring step of the SAME
                                  height.  Two same-height steps
                                  are, visually, one surface; no
                                  riser between them.  NOT drawn,
                                  and NOT added to fixed_obstacles.

The merging is done on the (axis, coordinate) line identity, not on
exact endpoint equality, so two collinear edges that only PARTIALLY
overlap are handled correctly.

Leader start point — visual text edge, not collision box
--------------------------------------------------------
A label carries two pairs of half-extents:

    (hw, hh)           the COLLISION BOX: generous, used for the
                       pairwise repulsion between labels and for the
                       "leader crosses another label" test.

    (hw, size × 0.35)  the VISUAL text extents: used only to place
                       the leader's tail.  A typical sans-serif has
                       cap height ≈ 0.7 em and no descender in our
                       labels, so the visible half-height is ≈ 0.35
                       × font size — the collision box is roughly
                       twice as tall.

Label targets
-------------
A label's `target` is a point, a polygon, or None.  Dimension tags
and door labels carry a point; column tags and STEP labels carry the
shape's own outline polygon.  A STEP label's preferred position is
chosen outside the polygon by _step_label_position so the label
starts in a free pocket; the polygon's edges remain normal obstacles.

Relaxation and routing
----------------------
Force relaxation, then a loop that pushes labels off leaders and
re-routes, then a verify-and-retry round.
