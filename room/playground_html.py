"""
playground_html.py — assembles the HTML/JS bundle from pg_core + pg_live
+ pg_arrows + pg_export.

pg_core.py    holds everything that defines the model, the storage format,
              and the passive infrastructure.
pg_live.py    holds everything interactive.
pg_arrows.py  holds the wall→plan escape-arrow field.
pg_export.py  holds the printable cable-run diagram exporter.

This file concatenates them, injects the geometry dict as
`const GEOMETRY`, splices the @font-face block into the head, and
prepends the FONT_MONO / FONT_SANS / FONT_FACE_CSS declarations that
every module below reads.  See playground_fonts.py for the single
knob that drives both playgrounds' fonts.
