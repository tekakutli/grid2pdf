mcp.py — Hand-Triggered Tool Router
===================================

PURPOSE
-------
This file is the *executor*. It holds the tool whitelist and the AST-
patching logic that runs a registered tool with overridden config
values. It does not describe what tools do, when to use them, or what
their parameters mean — that lives in INSTRUCT.md.

The pipeline is:

    human language  ->  (LLM)  ->  JSON  ->  [mcp.py]  ->  tool script runs

The JSON this router accepts is intentionally tiny:

    {
      "tool": "<tool_name>",
      "params": { "<VARIABLE_NAME>": <json value>, ... }
    }

Rules:
    * `tool` MUST match a key in TOOLS below.
    * Every key in `params` MUST appear in that tool's `params` list.
      Unknown keys are rejected outright to catch typos early.
    * Omitted params fall back to the defaults hard-coded in the tool
      script's CONFIGURATION block.
    * JSON values map to Python literals:
        string        -> str
        number        -> int or float
        true / false  -> bool
        null          -> None
        array         -> list
        object        -> dict
      These are inserted as *literal AST nodes*, never re-parsed as source,
      so a param value can never smuggle in executable code.
    * The OUTPUT_PDF param, if given without a file extension, gets
      ".pdf" appended automatically ("album" -> "album.pdf"). This is
      a convenience for the routing LLM, which emits OUTPUT_PDF
      verbatim; it is NOT license to guess at any other param.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVISION OF LABOR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file and INSTRUCT.md have distinct jobs and MUST NOT duplicate each
other's content:

    mcp.py       (this file)   the executor:
                                 * which tool names exist
                                 * which file implements each tool
                                 * which function is the entry point
                                 * which top-level variables may be patched
                                 * how JSON maps to AST and gets executed

    INSTRUCT.md                the routing manual:
                                 * what each tool does (use_case, objective)
                                 * what each tool produces (outputs)
                                 * what each tool is NOT (not_for)
                                 * what each param means, its type, its
                                   default, and the human phrasings that
                                   should map to it
                                 * worked examples and translation rules

WHEN THE TWO DISAGREE, THIS FILE WINS AT RUNTIME. INSTRUCT.md is a
routing *suggestion* for the LLM; this file is *policy*. If a tool name
or a param name is not in TOOLS below, the router rejects it — no matter
what INSTRUCT.md claims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR THE AI READING THIS FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the human asks you to extend this router, then:

    1. DO NOT emit a diff, a patch, or a partial fragment.
    2. Output the ENTIRE file verbatim, from the `#!` line to the final
       newline, with your edits applied in place.
    3. Preserve this docstring, the TOOLS registry shape, and every
       helper below. Where you change behavior, add a comment explaining
       *why* so the next reader understands.
    4. PRESERVE, DO NOT PRUNE. Every existing comment, docstring, section
       header, and prose block is here for a reason — usually because a
       previous edit was made *because* of a specific failure. Do not
       delete, merge, shorten, reword, or "clean up" anything you were
       not explicitly asked to change. If two passages seem redundant,
       they are almost certainly guarding two different failure modes;
       leave both. If a section looks stale or unused (for example, the
       SHELL INTEGRATION block below if the human has since replaced the
       wrapper), leave it anyway and mention it in your reply — the human
       decides what is dead, not you. When in doubt, add rather than
       remove. The docstring is long on purpose: its length IS the
       documentation, and trimming it destroys information that the next
       reader — human or AI — will need.

STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE TWO-FILE CHANGES. Adding a tool, adding a param,
or renaming either, requires editing BOTH this file (to whitelist the
name) AND INSTRUCT.md (to describe it for the routing LLM). Cosmetic
edits to INSTRUCT.md — rewording a spoken_as phrase, adding an example,
fixing prose — may be done alone. But whenever the *set* of tool names
or param names changes, both files must move together in the same pass.

To add a new tool:
    1. Drop its .py file into the same directory as this one.
    2. Add an entry to TOOLS below with exactly three keys:
         "file"   — filename, relative to this script's directory
         "entry"  — name of the function to call (usually "main")
         "params" — list of top-level variable NAMES in the tool's
                    source that may be overridden. Each name must
                    appear at module level in the tool file as a plain
                    `NAME = value` assignment; the AST patcher only
                    rewrites top-level assignments.
    3. Add a matching prose entry to INSTRUCT.md: description, use_case,
       objective, outputs, not_for, and per-param type/default/
       description/spoken_as.

NAMING CONVENTION: a tool's registry key SHOULD match its filename
without the ".py" extension. `imgs2pdf` points at `imgs2pdf.py`;
`grid2pdf` points at `grid2pdf.py`. When they diverge, prefer renaming
the key over renaming the file — the filename is what a human types at
the shell, the key is what the routing LLM emits, and keeping them
equal means a human reading the JSON can guess the file, and vice versa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOLERANCE POLICY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The router is deliberately STRICT about semantics and only mildly
TOLERANT about presentation. The line between the two is:

    ALLOWED (presentation-level, normalized away before parsing):
        * A single markdown code fence wrapping the JSON
          (```json ... ``` or bare ``` ... ```).
        * Leading / trailing whitespace and newlines.
        * Appending ".pdf" to OUTPUT_PDF when the value has no file
          extension. Bounded, single-param, documented here.
        These are unambiguously correct-but-wrapped inputs. Unwrapping
        them loses no information about the routing LLM's intent.

    FORBIDDEN (semantic-level, fail loudly):
        * Fuzzy tool-name matching ("grid" -> "grid2pdf").
        * Param-name aliases ("COLS" -> "GRID_COLS").
        * Silently dropping unknown params.
        * Coercing types, guessing at units, "fixing" obvious typos.
        * Alternate top-level keys ("parameters" for "params",
          "tool_name" for "tool", etc.).
        * Any other case where the router would have to *guess* what
          the LLM meant rather than read what it wrote.

Why the asymmetry: every tolerated variant is a place where a future
bug can hide. If the routing LLM emits "parameters" instead of "params"
and the router accepts both, the drift becomes invisible — you can no
longer tell whether INSTRUCT.md is being followed or ignored. Rejecting
loudly keeps the manual honest.

If you are an AI editing this file and you feel tempted to add a
semantic fallback because a routing AI "keeps getting it wrong": STOP.
The correct fix is almost always to edit INSTRUCT.md — clarify the rule,
add a worked example, sharpen a spoken_as list. Loosening the executor
hides the problem; fixing the manual removes it. Only add tolerance
when the input is unambiguously correct but wrapped differently
(fences, whitespace), never when the input is ambiguously wrong but
guessable. If you do add a tolerance, add it to the ALLOWED list above
with a one-line rationale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    python3 mcp.py path/to/instruction.json
    python3 mcp.py -              # read instruction JSON from stdin
    python3 mcp.py --self         # print this file (useful when editing)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHELL INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The intended human-facing entry point is a bash function `mcp` that
prompts for the instruction JSON on the terminal, accumulates lines
until the input parses, and pipes the result to this router via stdin.

Drop the following into ~/.bashrc (adjust MCP_PY to match the absolute
path of this file), then `source ~/.bashrc`:

    MCP_PY="$HOME/files/code/grid2pdf/mcp.py"

    mcp() {
        if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
            local json="" line lines=0
            printf 'json> ' > /dev/tty
            while IFS= read -r line < /dev/tty; do
                json+="$line"$'\n'
                lines=$((lines + 1))

                # Blank line = "I'm done, parse what I have."
                [[ -z "$line" && -n "${json//[$'\n']/}" ]] && break

                # Same tolerance as mcp.py: strip one wrapping fence, trim.
                if printf '%s' "$json" | python3 -c '
    import json, sys, re
    text = sys.stdin.read()
    m = re.match(r"^\s*```(?:json|JSON)?\s*\n?(.*?)\n?```\s*$", text, re.DOTALL)
    if m: text = m.group(1)
    json.loads(text.strip())
    ' 2>/dev/null; then
                    break
                fi

                # Bail after 200 lines — something is very wrong.
                if (( lines > 200 )); then
                    printf '\n[aborted: %d lines without parseable JSON]\n' "$lines" > /dev/tty
                    return 1
                fi
            done

            [[ -z "${json//[$'\n']/}" ]] && return 1

            # Drain any pending input (trailing prose after valid JSON).
            while IFS= read -r -t 0.05 _ < /dev/tty; do :; done

            printf '\n' > /dev/tty
            printf '%s' "$json" | python3 "$MCP_PY" -
        else
            python3 "$MCP_PY" "$@"
        fi
    }

Behavior notes for the shell wrapper (keep these in mind if you edit
either side):

    * With no arguments, `mcp` prompts on /dev/tty and reads lines until
      the accumulated text parses as JSON. A blank line forces an early
      parse attempt — useful as an escape hatch if the input is
      truncated.
    * It applies the same fence-strip tolerance as _load_instruction in
      this file, so a fenced paste is accepted at the prompt too.
    * The 200-line cap prevents a runaway paste from looping forever.
    * After a successful parse, pending input is drained so trailing
      prose (should the routing LLM ignore the "no prose" rule) does not
      leak into the next shell command.
    * With arguments, `mcp` forwards them verbatim to this file, so
      `mcp cmd.json`, `mcp -`, `mcp --self`, `mcp --help` all work as
      documented above.

The wrapper is a convenience, not a contract. This file's interface is
its command-line arguments and stdin; the `mcp` shell function is one
particular UX over that interface. If you replace the wrapper, nothing
in this file needs to change.
